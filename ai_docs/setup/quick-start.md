# Quick Start Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to get a PatternFly React application running quickly using the PatternFly React Seed.

## Introduction

The Quick Start process uses the official PatternFly React Seed repository to scaffold a complete application with pre-configured components, routing, and build tools. This is the fastest way to begin PatternFly development.

- [**PatternFly Guidelines**](../guidelines/README.md) - Development best practices
- [**Common Issues**](../troubleshooting/common-issues.md) - Troubleshooting setup problems

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react-seed
```

**AI Note**: This command can be executed by AI assistants to initialize the project.

### Step 2: Navigate to Project Directory

```bash
cd patternfly-react-seed
```

**Important**: All subsequent npm commands must be run from this directory.

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

**AI Note**: 
- AI can run this command after verifying Node.js and npm are properly installed
- This step downloads all required PatternFly and React dependencies
- May take several minutes depending on network speed

### Step 4: Start Development Server

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

**Important Considerations**:
- **User Recommendation**: Run this command in a separate terminal to keep it active
- **Default URL**: Development server typically runs at `http://localhost:9000`
- **Additional Information**: Check the project's [README.md](../../README.md) for server configuration details

## Verification Steps

After completing the setup:

1. **Check Server Status**: Ensure the development server starts without errors
2. **Access Application**: Open `http://localhost:9000` in a web browser
3. **Verify Components**: Confirm PatternFly components are rendering correctly
4. **Test Hot Reload**: Make a small change to verify live reloading works

## What You Get

The PatternFly React Seed includes:

### Pre-configured Components
- Page layout structure
- Navigation components
- Basic routing setup
- Example PatternFly components

### Development Tools
- Webpack configuration
- Hot module replacement
- Development server
- Build scripts

### Testing Setup
- Jest configuration
- Testing utilities
- Example test files

## Next Steps

1. **Explore the Codebase**: Review the generated file structure
2. **Read Documentation**: Check [PatternFly Guidelines](../guidelines/README.md)
3. **Start Development**: Begin building your application components
4. **Configure Environment**: Set up [Development Environment](./development-environment.md) tools

## Common Post-Setup Tasks

### Customizing the Application
- Update application name and metadata
- Configure routing for your specific needs
- Add custom components and pages

### Development Workflow
- Set up version control (if not already done)
- Configure IDE/editor for PatternFly development
- Install additional development tools

### Team Setup
- Share environment configuration
- Document custom setup steps
- Establish coding standards and practices

## Troubleshooting Quick Start

If you encounter issues during setup:

1. **Verify Prerequisites**: Ensure Node.js and npm are properly installed
2. **Check Network**: Confirm internet connectivity for package downloads
3. **Clear Cache**: Try `npm cache clean --force` if installation fails
4. **Port Conflicts**: If port 9000 is in use, check for alternative ports
5. **Permission Issues**: On Unix systems, avoid using `sudo` with npm
