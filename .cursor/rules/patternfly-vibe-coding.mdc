# PatternFly Vibe Coding Rule

## Purpose
Always reference the README and markdown documentation in this repository when generating, editing, or reviewing any PatternFly (PF) code. These files contain the authoritative best practices, guidelines, and up-to-date standards for PatternFly development.

## Scope
This rule applies to all code generation, refactoring, and review tasks involving PatternFly React, PatternFly Chatbot, and related UI components in this project.

## Documentation to Reference
- The root `README.md`
- The `documentation/README.md` file, which serves as the table of contents for all documentation in the `documentation/` directory and its subdirectories. Use this file to discover and navigate all relevant rules, guidelines, and best practices for PatternFly development.
- All markdown files referenced by `documentation/README.md`.

## Rule
- **Always consult the above documentation before generating or editing any PatternFly code.**
- **Use the documented best practices for component usage, styling, accessibility, and layout.**
- **Prefer semantic design tokens and utility classes as described in the docs.**
- **Follow accessibility and ARIA guidelines from the documentation.**
- **Reference official PatternFly components and avoid custom solutions unless explicitly allowed.**
- **If a question arises, search these docs first before using external sources.**

## Example Prompt
> "When generating PatternFly code, use the guidelines and examples from all README and markdown files in this repository, especially those referenced in documentation/README.md. Follow the documented best practices for styling, accessibility, and component usage."

## Enforcement
If code is generated or edited without following these documentation sources, request changes and point to the relevant section in the docs.
